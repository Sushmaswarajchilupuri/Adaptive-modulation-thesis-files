the MATLAB code to show the system performance of an adaptive modulation coding scheme in amplifying and forward relay networks over the Nakagami-m fading channel. Investigate the fading effect on the system performance, and analyze the fading parameters such as fading severity (m)and channel mean power (Ω). Therefore, to see the effect of channel mean power (Ω), we need the parameters: path loss exponent (n) and transmission distance (d).
